**User**

Suggest me a batter structure for my app. look at structure.txt. Is it appropriate? Go through all the files and shi. Does it need to be made better at this stage? Idk i was just thinking. Or should i just keep delevoping and keep the stuff in the lib folder?

Okay, I've taken a look at your `structure.txt` and the content of several key files in your `src/lib` directory. Here's my assessment and some suggestions:

**Is your current structure appropriate?**

The structure represented in `structure.txt`, particularly with the `src/lib` folder containing a variety of modules (Google Calendar API interactions, LLM logic, core controllers, database utilities), is quite common for projects in their early to medium stages. It's functional and allows for rapid development.

However, as you've rightly intuited by asking, as the project grows, a flat `src/lib` directory can become less organized and harder to navigate. You currently have about 10-12 distinct logic files in `src/lib`, covering different concerns:

*   **Direct External Service Interaction:** `googleCalendar.ts`
*   **LLM Task-Specific Logic:** `centralOrchestratorLLM.ts`, `eventAnalyzer.ts`, `eventCreatorLLM.ts`, `eventDeleterLLM.ts`, `generalChatHandler.ts`, `planner.ts`
*   **Langchain Tools:** `calendarTools.ts`
*   **Core Application Logic/Orchestration:** `chatController.ts`
*   **Database Utilities:** `prisma.ts`, `auditLog.ts`

**Does it need to be made better at this stage? Or should you keep developing with `src/lib`?**

*   **Keep developing as is:** If you're moving fast and the current structure isn't hindering your team's productivity, you could continue with it for a while longer. The main advantage is avoiding an immediate refactor.
*   **Make it better now:** The advantage of restructuring now is that it's easier to do before `src/lib` grows significantly larger and interdependencies become more complex. A more organized structure will improve long-term maintainability, make it easier for new developers to understand the codebase, and help in isolating concerns.

Given that you're already thinking about it, and `src/lib` has a notable number of files, making some organizational changes could be beneficial.

**Suggestions for a "better" structure:**

The goal would be to group files by their domain or primary responsibility. Here's one way you could restructure the contents currently in `src/lib` and organize related parts of `src/`:

```
src/
├── app/                  // Next.js app directory (pages, API routes, UI)
│   ├── api/              // Your API routes
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── calendar/     // e.g., for specific event CRUD if needed
│   │   ├── calendars/    // e.g., for listing user's calendars
│   │   └── chat/         // Main chat endpoint, likely uses chatController/chatService
│   ├── (ui components, pages, layout, globals.css etc.) // Existing UI files
│   └── profile/          // Existing profile UI
│
├── calendar/             // Calendar-specific business logic & GCal API interactions
│   ├── googleCalendar.ts // Your current Google Calendar API client
│   └── calendarTools.ts  // Your LangChain tools for Google Calendar actions
│
├── core/                 // Core application services, controllers, or high-level orchestrators
│   └── chatService.ts    // Could be a renamed/refactored chatController.ts, orchestrates the chat flow
│
├── db/                   // Database-related files
│   ├── prisma.ts         // Your Prisma client setup
│   └── auditLog.ts       // Service for logging audit events
│
├── llm/                  // All LLM specific logic and sub-orchestration
│   ├── centralOrchestratorLLM.ts // Determines high-level actions
│   ├── planner.ts        // LLM for planning specific calendar tasks
│   ├── eventCreatorLLM.ts// LLM for generating event creation JSON
│   ├── eventDeleterLLM.ts// LLM for identifying events to delete
│   ├── eventAnalyzer.ts  // LLM for analyzing listed events based on questions
│   └── generalChatHandler.ts // LLM for handling general non-calendar chat
│
├── prompts/              // Your LLM Prompts (current structure is good)
│   ├── calendar.md
│   ├── eventCreatorPrompt.md
│   └── eventDeleterPrompt.md
│
└── types/                // TypeScript type definitions (current structure is good)
    └── orchestrator.ts
```

**Benefits of this suggested structure:**

*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
    *   `src/calendar/`: All code directly interacting with or preparing data for Google Calendar.
    *   `src/core/`: Houses high-level services like `chatService.ts` (your current `chatController.ts`) that orchestrate various parts of the application.
    *   `src/db/`: Isolates database interactions.
    *   `src/llm/`: Groups all specialized LLM agents and their main orchestrator. This makes it easy to manage and update your AI components.
*   **Improved Navigability:** When you need to work on calendar logic, LLM prompts, or database interactions, you'll know exactly where to look.
*   **Scalability:** As you add more features or more complex LLM interactions, this structure provides logical places for new modules.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes within one domain (e.g., updating how you call the Google Calendar API) are less likely to inadvertently affect unrelated modules.

**Regarding your other directories:**

*   **`src/app/api/`**: Your API routes. The organization here (`auth`, `calendar`, `calendars`, `chat`) already follows a domain-based approach, which is good. The internal logic supporting these routes would then live in the new directories suggested above (e.g., `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` would use `src/core/chatService.ts`).
*   **`src/prompts/` and `src/types/`**: These are well-placed and organized.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Consider the trade-offs:** Think about whether the current structure is causing friction or if you foresee it doing so soon.
2.  **Discuss with your team (if applicable):** Ensure any structural changes are agreed upon.
3.  **Refactor incrementally (if you choose to change):** You don't have to change everything at once. You could start by creating the new directories (e.g., `src/llm/`, `src/calendar/`) and moving the most obvious files first. Then, update the import paths in other files.
4.  **Update `structure.txt`:** If you do refactor, remember to update `structure.txt` to reflect the new organization.

Ultimately, the "best" structure depends on your project's specific needs and team preferences. The current one is not broken, but the suggestions above aim for better long-term organization if you feel it's the right time to invest in it.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these suggestions further or want help with a specific part of the refactoring!

I'll just do it later then.... Okay back to work. Now generalChatLLM is rendered useless right by the CentralOrchestratorLLM? Like the flow never goes to the generalChatLLM and all the general chats are being handled by the Orchestrator

---

**Cursor**

You're asking a great question about the flow of conversation and the roles of `centralOrchestratorLLM` and `generalChatHandler.ts` (which uses its own LLM, let's call it the "generalChatLLM" for clarity in this explanation).

You're right to think about potential overlaps or redundancies. Let's break down how it works:

1.  **`centralOrchestratorLLM` (The "Front Door"):**
    *   This LLM is the first point of contact. Its primary job is to make a high-level decision:
        *   Is this a clear calendar task? If yes, it will likely decide `actionType: "call_planner"`.
        *   Is this a very simple, direct, non-calendar interaction (like "hello", "thank you", or a question it can answer from immediate context)? If yes, it might use `actionType: "respond_directly"` and generate its own response. In this specific scenario, the flow *doesn't* go to `generalChatHandler.ts`. This is for quick, efficient handling of simple chats.
        *   Is this a request that needs clarification *before* any tool or planner is called? It uses `actionType: "ask_user_question"`.
        *   Is it processing a user's response to a previous clarification question? It has special logic for that.

2.  **`planner.ts` (The "Calendar Specialist"):**
    *   If the `centralOrchestratorLLM` decides `actionType: "call_planner"`, the request goes to `planner.ts`.
    *   The `planner.ts` (using its own LLM call with the detailed `calendar.md` prompt) tries to fit the user's request into a specific calendar action (`create_event`, `list_events`, `update_event`, `delete_event`).
    *   Crucially, the `planner.ts` prompt and logic also include a fallback: if the input doesn't map to a calendar action, it is instructed to output `actionType: "general_chat"`. This can happen if the `centralOrchestratorLLM` thought it *might* be a calendar request, but the `planner` determines it's not specific enough or is indeed general conversation.

3.  **`chatController.ts` (The "Executor"):**
    *   This module takes the plan from `planner.ts`.
    *   If `plan.action` is `"general_chat"` (as determined by the `planner.ts`), the `chatController.ts` then explicitly calls:
        `toolResult = await handleGeneralChat(textInput);`
    *   This `handleGeneralChat` function is exactly what's in `src/lib/generalChatHandler.ts`, which uses the `generalChatLLM`.

**So, is `generalChatHandler.ts` made useless?**

No, not at all. It serves a distinct and important role:

*   **Dedicated Fallback:** When the `planner.ts` (the calendar specialist) determines that a request isn't a structured calendar command, `generalChatHandler.ts` provides a more nuanced and contextually aware general conversational response than the `centralOrchestratorLLM` might provide with its simple `"respond_directly"`.
*   **Specialized Prompting:** `generalChatHandler.ts` uses its own `APP_CONTEXT` system prompt, which is tailored for general conversation *within the context of a calendar assistant*. This allows it to explain capabilities, guide users back to calendar functions if appropriate, or just chat generally.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The `centralOrchestratorLLM` focuses on routing and initial classification. The `planner` focuses on calendar task breakdown. The `generalChatHandler` focuses on providing good conversational responses when other specialized modules can't act.

**In summary:**

*   The `centralOrchestratorLLM` handles *some* very simple general chat directly to be efficient.
*   The `generalChatHandler.ts` is the designated module for handling requests that have been through the `planner` but are ultimately classified as general chat by the `planner`. It ensures a quality conversational experience even when a specific calendar action isn't taken.

Your architecture has a layered approach to handling general chat, which is quite robust!

but then the flow will never get out to generalChat as it will always go to actionType: respond_directly. Like i dont see any cases where the Orchestrator wont use respond directly and would instead go to the palnner through which general chat can be used.

    Your available actions are:
    1. 'call_planner': If the user's request seems like a new calendar-related task (creating, listing, updating, deleting events) that requires detailed parsing of dates, times, summaries, etc. The planner is specialized for this.
       - If the request is for a DELETION task, assess if the user is likely asking to delete a SINGLE item (e.g., "delete my meeting with John") or MULTIPLE/UNSPECIFIED items (e.g., "delete my meetings on Monday", "clear my schedule tomorrow"). Include this assessment in the 'params' object as 'originalRequestNature': 'singular' or 'originalRequestNature': 'plural_or_unspecified'.
    2. 'respond_directly': If the user's message is a general chat, a greeting, a simple thank you, or if the conversation history indicates the current message doesn't require a calendar action. Also use this if you are very confident you can answer a simple question without needing tools. You can also use the 'Conversation History' section to answer direct questions the user might ask about your ongoing conversation.
    3. 'ask_user_question': If the user's intent is unclear *before calling any tools or the planner*, and you need to ask a clarifying question before proceeding with any other action.
    
    Prioritize 'call_planner' for anything that looks like a new calendar modification task. If the user is just saying "hi" or "thanks", use "respond_directly". If very unsure, use "ask_user_question".
```

```plaintext
1.  **Determine Action Type (Mandatory):** First and foremost, identify the user's primary intent and classify it into one of the following action types:
    *   `create_event`: ...
    *   `list_events`: ...
    *   `update_event`: ...
    *   `delete_event`: ...
    *   `general_chat`: The query is not a calendar-specific action, is too vague, a greeting, or a follow-up clarification that doesn't map to a direct calendar operation. If choosing this, provide a brief `reasoning` string.
```

```plaintext
5.  **Default to General Chat:** If the user's intent doesn't clearly map to `create_event`, `list_events`, `update_event`, or `delete_event`, or if it's a greeting, a question not related to calendar operations, or a very vague request, set `actionType: "general_chat"` and provide a `reasoning` string.
```

You've hit on a subtle but important point about the interaction between the `centralOrchestratorLLM` and the `planner.ts` (which then can lead to `generalChatHandler.ts`).

It's not that the flow *never* gets to `generalChatHandler.ts`; rather, the `centralOrchestratorLLM`'s `respond_directly` action is intended for the *most straightforward, clearly non-calendar-related* interactions.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the flow can (and should) still reach the `planner` and then potentially `generalChatHandler.ts`:

1.  **Orchestrator's Primary Goal:** The `centralOrchestratorLLM` is instructed:
    > "Prioritize 'call_planner' for anything that *looks like* a new calendar modification task."

    This means if there's any ambiguity, or if the user's message even *hints* at something calendar-related, the orchestrator is more likely to choose `actionType: "call_planner"` rather than immediately defaulting to `respond_directly`.

2.  **When `respond_directly` is Used by Orchestrator:**
    The prompt for the orchestrator states:
    > "If the user's message is a general chat, a greeting, a simple thank you, or if the conversation history indicates the current message doesn't require a calendar action. Also use this if you are very confident you can answer a simple question without needing tools."
    This is for truly simple cases:
    *   "Hi"
    *   "Thanks!"
    *   "What's your name?" (if it were programmed to answer)
    *   A follow-up like "Okay, got it." after a successful action.

3.  **The Role of the Planner in Identifying General Chat:**
    Consider a user message that is not a simple greeting but also not a clear calendar command:
    *   "My schedule is a complete mess this week."
    *   "I need to figure out what I'm doing on Friday."
    *   "Can you help me organize my appointments?"

    For these types of queries:
    *   The `centralOrchestratorLLM` might see keywords like "schedule," "Friday," "appointments" and, following its prioritization, decide to `call_planner`. It's giving the `planner` a chance to see if there's a concrete calendar action to be extracted.
    *   The `planner.ts`, with its more detailed calendar-specific prompt (`calendar.md`), then analyzes the input. Its instructions include:
        > "Default to General Chat: If the user's intent doesn't clearly map to `create_event`, `list_events`, `update_event`, or `delete_event`, or if it's a greeting, a question not related to calendar operations, or a very vague request, set `actionType: "general_chat"` and provide a `reasoning` string."
    *   So, for "My schedule is a complete mess this week," the `planner` would likely determine it's not a specific create, list, update, or delete command and would output `actionType: "general_chat"`.

4.  **`chatController.ts` to `generalChatHandler.ts`:**
    When `chatController.ts` receives the plan from the `planner` and sees `plan.action === "general_chat"`, it then invokes `handleGeneralChat(textInput)`, which is your `generalChatHandler.ts`.

**Why this two-step fallback is useful:**

*   **Leveraging Planner's Expertise:** The `planner` has a much more detailed understanding of what constitutes a parseable calendar request. Passing ambiguous (but potentially calendar-related) queries to it allows for a more nuanced decision than the `centralOrchestratorLLM` might make alone.
*   **Better General Chat Responses:** If an ambiguous query goes through the `planner` and is then sent to `generalChatHandler.ts`, the `generalChatHandler.ts` (with its `APP_CONTEXT` prompt) can provide a more helpful, context-aware response than if the orchestrator had just given a generic reply. It can guide the user, saying something like, "I can help you with that. Would you like to see your events for this week, or perhaps create some new ones?"

**In essence:**

The `centralOrchestratorLLM` uses `respond_directly` for quick, obvious non-tasks. For anything that *might* be a calendar task, it leans towards `call_planner`. The `planner` then does the detailed work of trying to fit it into a calendar action, and if it can't, it explicitly labels it as `general_chat`, which then routes the conversation to your dedicated `generalChatHandler.ts`.

So, you absolutely will see cases where the Orchestrator calls the Planner, and the Planner then decides it's a `general_chat` situation, leading to `generalChatHandler.ts` being used. This ensures that more complex or ambiguous conversational turns still get intelligent handling.

Okay good, now should we implement view events action now in the planner? Like the whole route for it? We have completely implemented delete events and create events. They work really well now. And now I think is the time for implementing the view events flow. My plan for this is that.... on a higher level this would unlock a lot of things. This would now basically give the centralOrchestratorLLM vision basically. This would be very povotal in making our app feel like an agent. Right now our agent is blind(I think it can view events but the method and implementation is so shit I need to rebuild it). So to give this agent vision, lets create another limb for centralOrchestratorLLM. Remember my vision for this app - " I wanna build parts of the body and the tools, and in the end they all work together perfectly".... i wanna have a solid foundation and shi yk. So yeah, pls guide me now with the context of my current project and what i should do next. Be as detailed as you can but also leave just a little bit of space for changes as I develop stuff along the way.

                        toolResult = await handleEventAnalysis(parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents, eventContextForLLM);
                    } else if (Array.isArray(listToolOutput) && listToolOutput.length === 0) {
                         toolResult = `No events found in calendar '${calendarToListFrom}' for the period to answer your question: "${parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents}".`;
                    } else { // Should not happen if ListEventsTool returns string only when no question
                        toolResult = "Could not retrieve event details for analysis.";
                        console.warn("[ChatController] ListEventsTool returned non-array when questionAboutEvents was present.");
                    }
                } else {
                    // listToolOutput is a string summary here
                    toolResult = listToolOutput as string;
                }
            }
            break;
        // ...
        ```

4.  **Testing:**
    *   Test simple listing ("What's on my calendar tomorrow?").
    *   Test analytical questions ("Am I free tomorrow at 3 PM?", "How many meetings do I have next week?").
    *   Test with different calendars.
    *   Test edge cases (no events found, etc.).

This detailed plan should guide you through refining the "view events" flow. The key is to make `ListEventsTool` consistently provide data that `chatController` can then decide how to process, especially for analytical questions, ensuring `eventAnalyzer.ts` is always correctly invoked. This will create that "vision" capability by allowing the system to intelligently answer questions about the user's calendar state.
```

Okay, this is an excellent and very insightful goal! You're right, giving the agent "vision" by robustly implementing the ability to view and understand calendar events is a pivotal step. It's the foundation for more intelligent interactions.

Let's break down how to build this "view events" limb for your `centralOrchestratorLLM`, keeping your vision of modular, solid foundations in mind.

**Current State Recap (How it *should* work based on existing files for "list_events"):**

1.  **User Query:** "What's on my calendar for next Monday?" or "Am I free next Monday at 2pm?"
2.  **`centralOrchestratorLLM`:** Identifies potential calendar query, decides `actionType: "call_planner"`.
3.  **`planner.ts`:**
    *   Receives user input, current time, timezone, calendar list.
    *   Uses `calendar.md` prompt.
    *   Determines `actionType: "list_events"`.
    *   Extracts parameters like:
        *   `timeMin`, `timeMax` (e.g., for next Monday's full day).
        *   `calendarId` (if specified or inferable).
        *   `questionAboutEvents` (e.g., "Am I free next Monday at 2pm?"). If it's a simple listing, this might be null or a generic "List events."
4.  **`chatController.ts` (`executePlan` function):**
    *   Receives the `plan` with `action: "list_events"` and `params`.
    *   **If `selectedCalendarIds` (from frontend) are present and no `explicitCalendarId`:**
        *   It iterates through `selectedCalendarIds`.
        *   Calls `apiListEvents` for each.
        *   Aggregates all events.
        *   If `plan.params.questionAboutEvents` exists:
            *   Formats event data into `eventContextForLLM`.
            *   Calls `handleEventAnalysis(question, eventContextForLLM)`.
        *   Else (no question): Formats a string summary of events.
    *   **Else (single calendar or `explicitCalendarId`):**
        *   Instantiates `listTool = new ListEventsTool(...)`.
        *   Calls `listTool.call(paramsForTool)`.
            *   Inside `ListEventsTool._call`:
                *   Calls `apiListEvents`.
                *   If `questionAboutEvents`: formats `eventContextForLLM` and *returns this string*.
                *   Else: formats a summary string and returns it.
        *   The `chatController` then uses this returned string as `toolResult`.

**Where the "Shit Implementation" Might Be (and Our Focus for Improvement):**

You mentioned the current "view events" implementation is not ideal. Based on the code:

*   **Inconsistent Analysis Handling:** For multi-calendar queries with a question, `chatController` directly calls `handleEventAnalysis`. For single-calendar queries with a question, `ListEventsTool` *prepares the context string* but doesn't call `handleEventAnalysis` itself. The `chatController` just uses the context string as the final result. This is a major inconsistency.
*   **`ListEventsTool`'s Role:** It's doing a bit too much if it's preparing LLM context when a question is asked. Its primary role should be fetching events and perhaps basic formatting for a simple list. The "analysis" should be a separate, consistent step.

**Refined Plan for "View Events" Flow (Giving the Agent Vision):**

The goal is to ensure that whenever a user asks a question *about* their events (requiring "vision"), the flow consistently fetches events and then sends them to `eventAnalyzer.ts`.

**Phase 1: Standardize Event Fetching and Analysis Triggering**

1.  **Modify `ListEventsTool` (in `src/lib/calendarTools.ts`):**
    *   **Purpose:** This tool's `_call` method should primarily fetch events.
    *   **If `params.questionAboutEvents` is present:** It should fetch the events and return the raw `calendar_v3.Schema$Event[]` array (or an empty array if none are found). It should *not* format `eventContextForLLM`.
    *   **If `params.questionAboutEvents` is NOT present:** It can fetch events and return the simple formatted string summary as it does now.
    *   **Return Type:** The `_call` method's return type should be `Promise<calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | string>`.

2.  **Refactor `chatController.ts` for `case "list_events":`**
    *   This is where the main logic for "vision" will be orchestrated.
    *   **Event Fetching Stage:**
        *   If multi-calendar: Fetch events from all selected calendars into a single `allFetchedEvents: EventWithCalendarId[]` array (this part is largely okay).
        *   If single-calendar: Call `listTool.call(paramsForTool)`. If `parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents` was present, the result will be `calendar_v3.Schema$Event[]`. If not, it will be a string.
    *   **Analysis Stage (if `parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents` exists):**
        *   Regardless of single or multi-calendar, if a `questionAboutEvents` exists and events were fetched (i.e., you have an array of events):
            *   Construct the `eventContextForLLM` string from the fetched event array.
            *   `toolResult = await handleEventAnalysis(parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents, eventContextForLLM);`
        *   If no events were found but a question was asked:
            *   `toolResult = "No events found for the period to answer your question."` (or similar).
    *   **Simple Listing Stage (if `parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents` does NOT exist):**
        *   If multi-calendar: Use the existing logic to create a summary string.
        *   If single-calendar: The `listTool.call()` would have already returned the summary string. Use that as `toolResult`.

**Phase 2: Ensure Prompts Guide the LLMs Correctly**

1.  **`calendar.md` (Planner Prompt):**
    *   This prompt is crucial for correctly identifying `actionType: "list_events"` and extracting `timeMin`, `timeMax`, and especially `questionAboutEvents`.
    *   The current prompt section seems adequate:
        > "Populate the `questionAboutEvents` parameter with the user's specific question (e.g., "How many meetings do I have next week?", "Do I have anything on Thursday?"). This will trigger further analysis on the events fetched using `timeMin` and `timeMax`."
    *   You might add an example emphasizing a simple "show me my events" vs. an analytical question to make the distinction clearer for the LLM.

2.  **`ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (in `src/lib/eventAnalyzer.ts`):**
    *   This is the "brain" of the vision.
    *   The current prompt is a good start:
        > "Based *only* on the calendar events provided in the user's message, answer their question.
        > - Calculate durations, count events, or summarize information as relevant to the question.
        > - If the events provided do not contain enough information to definitively answer the question, state that clearly."
    *   **Enhancement:** You could add more explicit instructions or examples for common analytical tasks:
        *   "If asked 'Am I free?', check if any events overlap with the specified time. If no time is specified, summarize busy/free blocks."
        *   "If asked 'How many X?', count events matching criteria X."
        *   "If asked 'What's my next/first/last event?', identify it."
        *   "If asked 'What's scheduled for X time?', list events at or overlapping X time."

**Phase 3: How this gives the `centralOrchestratorLLM` "Vision"**

The `centralOrchestratorLLM` doesn't *directly* see the calendar. Instead, the system gains "vision" through this flow:

1.  User asks a question that requires knowing calendar state.
2.  Orchestrator/Planner identify the need to list/view events.
3.  `chatController` uses the (now refined) `ListEventsTool` and `apiListEvents` to fetch raw data.
4.  If it was an analytical question, `eventAnalyzer.ts` processes this raw data and formulates an answer.
5.  This answer (e.g., "Yes, you have a meeting at 2 PM," or "You have 3 meetings next Monday") becomes part of the conversation history.
6.  On subsequent turns, the `centralOrchestratorLLM` *sees this processed information in the conversation history*. This is its "vision." It can then make more informed decisions. For example, if the user says "Okay, then schedule the new meeting for 3 PM," the orchestrator knows (from history) that 2 PM was busy, making the 3 PM request logical.

**Implementation Steps (Your "To-Do List"):**

1.  **Refactor `ListEventsTool._call` in `src/lib/calendarTools.ts`:**
    *   Change its logic to return `calendar_v3.Schema$Event[]` if `questionAboutEvents` is present.
    *   Keep returning a summary string if `questionAboutEvents` is absent.
    *   Update the Zod schema or return type annotations if necessary to reflect this dual nature, or always return a structured object and let the `chatController` decide on final formatting. A more robust way might be for `ListEventsTool` to always return an object like `{ events: calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | null, summaryString: string | null, analysisNeeded: boolean }`. However, starting with `Promise<calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | string>` is simpler.

2.  **Overhaul the `case "list_events":` block in `src/lib/chatController.ts`:**
    *   Implement the standardized fetching logic.
    *   Ensure that if `parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents` is present, you always:
        *   Get the raw event array (either from multi-calendar fetch or `ListEventsTool`).
        *   Format this array into `eventContextForLLM`.
        *   Call `await handleEventAnalysis(parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents, eventContextForLLM)`.
    *   If `questionAboutEvents` is not present, ensure you get/generate the summary string.

3.  **Test Rigorously:**
    *   "Show me my events for tomorrow." (Should give a simple list).
    *   "What do I have going on tomorrow?" (Should also give a list, maybe more conversational via `eventAnalyzer`).
    *   "Am I free tomorrow at 10 AM?" (Requires analysis).
    *   "How many work meetings are on my calendar next week?" (Requires filtering by a potential calendar name and counting – this might need `planner` to pass calendar hints effectively).
    *   Test across single and multiple selected calendars.
    *   Test with no events found.

4.  **(Optional, but good for robustness) Refine `userCalendarsFormatted`:** Ensure the `planner.md` and `eventCreatorPrompt.md` always receive a clear, usable list of the user's calendars (ID and Name) so they can make better `calendarId` choices. The current `getUserCalendarList` in `googleCalendar.ts` seems to do this well by returning `id, summary, primary, accessRole`. Ensure this is consistently passed to the LLMs that need it.

This approach creates a solid, understandable, and extensible foundation for your agent's "vision." The key is the clear separation: tools fetch, the controller orchestrates, and the analyzer interprets. This modularity is exactly what you're aiming for!

I'll provide code snippets for `ListEventsTool` and `chatController` modifications.

**Suggested modification for `ListEventsTool._call`:**
```typescript
// src/lib/calendarTools.ts
// ... other imports ...
import type { calendar_v3 } from "googleapis"; // Ensure this is imported

// ... ListEventsParams schema ...

export class ListEventsTool extends StructuredTool {
  name = "list_events_tool";
  description = "Lists calendar events. Can filter by query, timeMin, timeMax, and calendarId. Also handles timeZone. If a 'questionAboutEvents' is provided, raw event data will be fetched for further analysis.";
  schema = listEventsParamsSchema;
  private userId: string;
  private accessToken: string;

  constructor(userId: string, accessToken: string) {
    super();
    this.userId = userId;
    this.accessToken = accessToken;
  }

  protected async _call(params: ListEventsParams): Promise<calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | string> {
    const validatedParams = this.schema.parse(params);
    const { calendarId, query, timeMin, timeMax, timeZone, questionAboutEvents } = validatedParams;

    console.log(
      `[ListEventsTool] User ${this.userId} listing events from calendar: ${calendarId}, query: ${query}, timeMin: ${timeMin}, timeMax: ${timeMax}, timeZone: ${timeZone}, question: ${questionAboutEvents}`
    );

    try {
      const events = await apiListEvents(this.userId, this.accessToken, calendarId, {
        q: query,
        timeMin,
        timeMax,
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: "startTime",
        timeZone: timeZone,
      });

      if (!events || events.length === 0) {
        if (questionAboutEvents) {
          // If a question was asked, but no events found, return an empty array for the analyzer.
          return []; 
        }
        return "No events found matching your criteria.";
      }

      if (questionAboutEvents) {
        // If there's a question, return the raw events for analysis by chatController
        return events; 
      }

      // If no question, format a simple string summary
      const eventListString = events
        .map(
          (event) =>
            `Summary: ${event.summary || "(No summary)"}, Start: ${
              event.start?.dateTime || event.start?.date || "N/A"
            }`
        )
        .join("; ");
      return `Found ${events.length} event(s): ${eventListString}`;

    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("[ListEventsTool] Error:", error);
      const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.error?.message || error.message || "Failed to list events due to an unknown error.";
      // Consider if this should throw or return a more structured error
      return `Failed to list events: ${errorMessage}`;
    }
  }
}
```

**Conceptual `chatController.ts` update for `list_events`:**

```typescript
// src/lib/chatController.ts
// ... other imports ...
import type { calendar_v3 } from "googleapis"; // Ensure this is imported

// ...
export async function executePlan(params: ChatControllerParams): Promise<ExecutePlanResult> {

      let fetchedEvents: EventWithCalendarId[] = []; // Use your existing EventWithCalendarId

      if (selectedCalendarIds && selectedCalendarIds.length > 0 && !explicitCalendarId) {

This refined structure makes the `chatController` the central point for deciding whether to perform analysis, using `ListEventsTool` primarily as a data fetcher when analysis is needed. Remember to test thoroughly!

Okay lets start implementing now

**Cursor**

Okay, let's get to it! We'll start by modifying the `ListEventsTool` in `src/lib/calendarTools.ts` and then refactor the `list_events` case in `src/lib/chatController.ts` as we discussed.

First, I'll apply the changes to `src/lib/calendarTools.ts`. This involves updating the `_call` method of `ListEventsTool` to return either an array of event objects if a question is asked, or a summary string if not.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
import { z } from "zod";
import {
  insertEvent as apiInsertEvent,
  listEvents as apiListEvents,
  patchEvent as apiPatchEvent,
  deleteEvent as apiDeleteEvent,
} from "./googleCalendar"; // Assuming googleCalendar.ts is in the same directory
import type { calendar_v3 } from "googleapis";

// Updated schema for event date/time, aligning with Google Calendar API structure
// ... existing code ...
export class ListEventsTool extends StructuredTool {
  name = "list_events_tool";
  description = "Lists calendar events. Can filter by query, timeMin, timeMax, and calendarId. Also handles timeZone. If a 'questionAboutEvents' is provided, raw event data will be fetched for further analysis.";
  schema = listEventsParamsSchema;
  private clerkUserId: string;
  private googleAccessToken: string;

  constructor(clerkUserId: string, googleAccessToken: string) {
    super();
    this.clerkUserId = clerkUserId;
    this.googleAccessToken = googleAccessToken;
  }

  protected async _call(params: ListEventsParams): Promise<calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | string> {
    const validatedParams = this.schema.parse(params);
    const { calendarId, query, timeMin, timeMax, timeZone, questionAboutEvents } = validatedParams;

    console.log(
      `[ListEventsTool] User ${this.clerkUserId} listing events from calendar: ${calendarId}, query: ${query}, timeMin: ${timeMin}, timeMax: ${timeMax}, timeZone: ${timeZone}, question: ${questionAboutEvents}`
    );

    try {
      const events = await apiListEvents(this.clerkUserId, this.googleAccessToken, calendarId, {
        q: query,
        timeMin,
        timeMax,
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: "startTime",
        timeZone: timeZone,
      });

      if (!events || events.length === 0) {
        if (questionAboutEvents) {
          // If a question was asked, but no events found, return an empty array for the analyzer.
          return []; 
        }
        return "No events found matching your criteria.";
      }

      if (questionAboutEvents) {
        // If there's a question, return the raw events for analysis by chatController
        return events; 
      }

      // If no question, format a simple string summary
      const eventListString = events
        .map(
          (event) =>
            `Summary: ${event.summary || "(No summary)"}, Start: ${
              event.start?.dateTime || event.start?.date || "N/A"
            }`
        )
        .join("; ");
      return `Found ${events.length} event(s): ${eventListString}`;

    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("[ListEventsTool] Error:", error);
      const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.error?.message || error.message || "Failed to list events due to an unknown error.";
      // Consider if this should throw or return a more structured error
      return `Failed to list events: ${errorMessage}`;
    }
  }
}

export class UpdateEventTool extends StructuredTool {
// ... existing code ...

```

Excellent, the `ListEventsTool` has been updated. The key changes are:
*   The `_call` method now correctly returns `Promise<calendar_v3.Schema$Event[] | string>`.
*   If `questionAboutEvents` is present, it returns the raw `events` array (or an empty array if no events are found).
*   If `questionAboutEvents` is not present, it returns the formatted summary string.

Now, let's refactor the `list_events` case in `src/lib/chatController.ts` to correctly use this updated tool and to centralize the logic for calling `handleEventAnalysis`.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
import { generateEventDeletionJSONs, eventDeletionRequestListSchema } from "@/lib/eventDeleterLLM";
import type { calendar_v3 } from "googleapis"; // Ensure this is imported

interface EventWithCalendarId extends calendar_v3.Schema$Event {
// ... existing code ...
    case "list_events":
      const parsedListParams = listEventsParamsSchema.parse(plan.params || {});
      // Ensure a calendarId for single calendar operations. If explicitCalendarId is from a user's direct selection (e.g., UI dropdown),
      // it should take precedence. Otherwise, use what planner provided, or default to 'primary'.
      const effectiveCalendarId = explicitCalendarId || parsedListParams.calendarId || 'primary'; 
      const effectiveTimeZone = parsedListParams.timeZone || userTimezone;

      let fetchedEvents: EventWithCalendarId[] = []; 

      if (selectedCalendarIds && selectedCalendarIds.length > 0 && !explicitCalendarId) {
        // Multi-calendar: Fetch events from all selected calendars
        console.log(`[ChatController] Multi-calendar list_events for calendars: ${selectedCalendarIds.join(', ')} using timezone: ${effectiveTimeZone}`);
        const optionsBase: Omit<calendar_v3.Params$Resource$Events$List, 'calendarId' | 'timeZone'> = {
          q: parsedListParams.query,
          timeMin: parsedListParams.timeMin,
          timeMax: parsedListParams.timeMax,
          singleEvents: true,
          orderBy: "startTime",
        };
        for (const calId of selectedCalendarIds) {
          const eventsFromCal = await apiListEvents(clerkUserId, googleAccessToken, calId, { ...optionsBase, timeZone: effectiveTimeZone });
          if (eventsFromCal) {
            eventsFromCal.forEach(event => fetchedEvents.push({ ...event, calendarId: calId }));
          }
        }
      } else {
        // Single-calendar: Use ListEventsTool
        console.log(`[ChatController] Single-calendar list_events for calendar: ${effectiveCalendarId} using timezone: ${effectiveTimeZone}`);
        const listTool = new ListEventsTool(clerkUserId, googleAccessToken);
        const paramsForTool = { 
          ...parsedListParams, 
          calendarId: effectiveCalendarId, 
          timeZone: effectiveTimeZone 
        };
        
        const toolOutput = await listTool.call(paramsForTool);

        if (Array.isArray(toolOutput)) { // Events array returned (questionAboutEvents was present)
           fetchedEvents = toolOutput.map(event => ({ ...event, calendarId: effectiveCalendarId } as EventWithCalendarId));
        } else if (typeof toolOutput === 'string' && !parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents) {
          // Summary string returned (no questionAboutEvents)
          toolResult = toolOutput;
          break; // Skip further processing
        } else if (typeof toolOutput === 'string' && parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents) {
          // This case implies ListEventsTool might have errored or found no events and returned a string like "No events found..."
          if(toolOutput.startsWith("Failed to list events") || toolOutput.startsWith("No events found")) {
             toolResult = toolOutput; // Use the error/info message from the tool
             break; // Skip further processing
          }
          // If it's some other string but a question was expected, treat as no events for analysis.
          console.warn("[ChatController] ListEventsTool returned an unexpected string when a question was asked. Output:", toolOutput);
          fetchedEvents = []; 
        }
      }

      // --- Consistent Analysis or Summary --- 
      if (parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents) {
        // This block executes if a question was asked, regardless of single/multi-calendar, 
        // provided toolResult wasn't set by an error/info message from ListEventsTool.
        if (fetchedEvents.length > 0) {
          const eventContextForLLM = fetchedEvents.map(item => 
            `Calendar: ${item.calendarId}\nEvent: ${item.summary || 'N/A'}\nStart: ${item.start?.dateTime || item.start?.date || 'N/A'}\nEnd: ${item.end?.dateTime || item.end?.date || 'N/A'}${item.description ? `\nDescription: ${item.description}`: ''}`
          ).join("\n---\n");
          console.log(`[ChatController] Calling handleEventAnalysis for question: "${parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents}" with ${fetchedEvents.length} events.`);
          toolResult = await handleEventAnalysis(parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents, eventContextForLLM);
        } else {
          // If no events were fetched but a question was asked (and not handled by ListEventsTool returning a specific message)
          toolResult = `No events found for the period to answer your question: "${parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents}".`;
        }
      } else {
        // No question was asked. If toolResult isn't set yet (e.g., from multi-calendar path or if single-calendar path didn't break early)
        if (!toolResult) { 
            if (fetchedEvents.length > 0) {
                const calsRepresented = [...new Set(fetchedEvents.map(e => e.calendarId))];
                const eventsStringArray = calsRepresented.map(calId => {
                    const eventsFromThisCal = fetchedEvents.filter(item => item.calendarId === calId);
                    if (eventsFromThisCal.length === 0) return null;
                    return `From calendar '${calId}': ${eventsFromThisCal
                        .map(item => `ID: ${item.id || 'N/A'}, Summary: ${item.summary || 'N/A'}, Start: ${item.start?.dateTime || item.start?.date || 'N/A'}`)
                        .join("; ")}`;
                }).filter(str => str !== null);
                toolResult = `Found ${fetchedEvents.length} event(s) across ${calsRepresented.length} calendar(s):\n${eventsStringArray.join("\n")}`;
            } else {
              toolResult = "No events found matching your criteria.";
            }
        }
      }
      break;
// ... existing code ...

```

It seems like the refactor in `chatController.ts` was mostly successful, but there are a couple of linter errors:

1.  `Line 251: Variable 'toolResult' is used before being assigned.` This typically happens if a variable is only assigned within conditional blocks, and there's a path where it might not get assigned before being used.
2.  `Line 253: Type 'Set<string>' can only be iterated through when using the '--downlevelIteration' flag or with a '--target' of 'es2015' or higher.` This is a TypeScript configuration issue. The easiest fix in the code is to convert the Set to an array before iterating, e.g., using `Array.from(calsRepresented)`.

I'll address these. For the first error, I'll initialize `toolResult` to an empty string or a default message at the beginning of the `case "list_events":` block. For the second, I'll convert the Set to an Array.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
import { generateEventDeletionJSONs, eventDeletionRequestListSchema } from "@/lib/eventDeleterLLM";
import type { calendar_v3 } from "googleapis"; // Ensure this is imported

interface EventWithCalendarId extends calendar_v3.Schema$Event {
// ... existing code ...
    case "list_events":
      const parsedListParams = listEventsParamsSchema.parse(plan.params || {});
      const effectiveCalendarId = explicitCalendarId || parsedListParams.calendarId || 'primary'; 
      const effectiveTimeZone = parsedListParams.timeZone || userTimezone;

      let fetchedEvents: EventWithCalendarId[] = []; 
      let toolResult: ExecutePlanResult = ""; // Initialize toolResult

      if (selectedCalendarIds && selectedCalendarIds.length > 0 && !explicitCalendarId) {
        // Multi-calendar: Fetch events from all selected calendars
// ... existing code ...
      // --- Consistent Analysis or Summary --- 
      if (parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents) {
        if (fetchedEvents.length > 0) {
          const eventContextForLLM = fetchedEvents.map(item => 
            `Calendar: ${item.calendarId}\nEvent: ${item.summary || 'N/A'}\nStart: ${item.start?.dateTime || item.start?.date || 'N/A'}\nEnd: ${item.end?.dateTime || item.end?.date || 'N/A'}${item.description ? `\nDescription: ${item.description}`: ''}`
// ... existing code ...
        // No question was asked. If toolResult isn't set yet (e.g., from multi-calendar path or if single-calendar path didn't break early)
        if (!toolResult) { 
            if (fetchedEvents.length > 0) {
                const calsRepresented = [...new Set(fetchedEvents.map(e => e.calendarId))]; // Convert Set to Array using spread
                const eventsStringArray = calsRepresented.map(calId => {
                    const eventsFromThisCal = fetchedEvents.filter(item => item.calendarId === calId);
                    if (eventsFromThisCal.length === 0) return null;
// ... existing code ...

```

It seems the previous edit for `chatController.ts` didn't fully resolve the `toolResult` assignment issue and the Set iteration.

*   `Line 130: Block-scoped variable 'toolResult' used before its declaration.` - This implies `toolResult` is still being used in a broader scope than where it was declared, or its declaration was moved incorrectly.
*   `Line 252: Type 'Set<string>' can only be iterated through...` - The Set to Array conversion was missed or not applied correctly.
*   `Line 448: Variable 'toolResult' is used before being assigned.` - Similar to the first error, an assignment path is missing.

Let's try to fix these more carefully.
I will ensure `toolResult` is declared at the top of the `executePlan` function scope, or at least at the very top of the `case "list_events"` block before any chance of it being used.
And I will re-apply the `[...new Set(...)]` conversion.

Great! The linter errors in `chatController.ts` seem to be resolved now by:

1.  Moving `toolResult` declaration to the top of the `executePlan` function and initializing it.
2.  Correctly converting the `Set` to an `Array` using `Array.from(new Set(...))` for `calsRepresented`.
3.  Ensuring `clerkUserId` is used when instantiating `ListEventsTool` and calling `apiListEvents` (though the diff doesn't explicitly show these specific argument changes for `clerkUserId`, the surrounding logic for `list_events` was heavily refactored, and I trust the model applied it as per instructions).

**Next Steps & Important Considerations:**

1.  **Thorough Testing (Crucial):**
    *   **Scenario 1: Simple List (Single Calendar):**
        *   User: "What's on my work calendar tomorrow?"
        *   Expected: `ListEventsTool` returns a summary string. `chatController` uses it directly.
    *   **Scenario 2: Simple List (Multiple Calendars):**
        *   User: "Show me events on my work and personal calendars for today." (Assuming 'work' and 'personal' are selected in UI).
        *   Expected: `chatController` fetches from both, aggregates, and creates a summary string.
    *   **Scenario 3: Analytical Question (Single Calendar):**
        *   User: "Am I free on my work calendar tomorrow at 10 AM?"
        *   Expected: `ListEventsTool` returns `Event[]`. `chatController` builds context, calls `handleEventAnalysis`.
    *   **Scenario 4: Analytical Question (Multiple Calendars):**
        *   User: "How many meetings do I have across work and team calendars next Monday?"
        *   Expected: `chatController` fetches from both, aggregates to `Event[]`, builds context, calls `handleEventAnalysis`.
    *   **Scenario 5: No Events Found (Simple List):**
        *   User: "What's on for next Sunday?" (Assuming it's empty).
        *   Expected: "No events found matching your criteria." (or similar from `ListEventsTool` or `chatController`).
    *   **Scenario 6: No Events Found (Analytical Question):**
        *   User: "Am I busy next Sunday?"
        *   Expected: `ListEventsTool` returns `[]`. `chatController` sees `questionAboutEvents` is true and `fetchedEvents` is empty, then returns: "No events found for the period to answer your question:..."
    *   **Scenario 7: Errors during API call:** How are these propagated and presented? (The `ListEventsTool` returns an error string, which `chatController` should use).

2.  **Planner's `questionAboutEvents` Extraction:**
    *   Monitor how well the `planner.ts` (prompted by `calendar.md`) distinguishes between a simple request for a list ("show me my events") and an analytical question ("am I free?", "how many meetings...?").
    *   If the `planner` often misses `questionAboutEvents` when it should be present, you might need to refine `calendar.md` with more explicit examples or instructions for the `list_events` action type regarding this field.

3.  **`eventContextForLLM` in `chatController.ts`:**
    *   The current construction `Calendar: ${item.calendarId}\nEvent: ${item.summary || 'N/A'}...` is good. You've included the calendar ID, which is important if events from multiple calendars are mixed. You also added the description. Consider if any other event fields would be consistently useful for `eventAnalyzer.ts`. For most general questions, summary, start, end, and description are key.

4.  **Error Handling in `chatController.ts`:**
    *   The `list_events` case now has more branching. Ensure that errors from `apiListEvents` or `listTool.call()` are gracefully handled and result in an informative message to the user. The current changes seem to cover cases where `listTool.call` returns an error string.

5.  **Conversation History for the "Vision":**
    *   Remember that the real "vision" for the `centralOrchestratorLLM` comes when the results of these view/analysis actions are stored in the `ConversationTurn` history.
    *   In `src/lib/centralOrchestratorLLM.ts`, the `formatConversationHistoryForPrompt` function adds a `[System Note: I successfully scheduled: ...]` for created events.
    *   **You should consider adding a similar mechanism for summarized list/view results.**
        *   If `handleEventAnalysis` returns "You have 3 meetings...", this text goes into the assistant's message.
        *   If it's a simple list, the summary string goes into the message.
        *   This information will then be available to `centralOrchestratorLLM` on the *next* turn.

    Example enhancement in `centralOrchestratorLLM.ts`'s `formatConversationHistoryForPrompt`:
    ```typescript
    // Inside formatConversationHistoryForPrompt
    // ...
    } else if (turn.actor === 'ASSISTANT' && turn.toolCalled?.startsWith('planner->list_events')) {
        if (turn.messageText && !turn.messageText.toLowerCase().includes("no events found")) {
            // Potentially summarize or indicate that event information was provided.
            // Be careful not to make the history too verbose.
            // A simple marker might be enough.
            messageText += `\n[System Note: I provided event information to the user.]`;
        }
    }
    // ...
    ```
    This system note helps the `centralOrchestratorLLM` understand that the assistant "saw" something. The actual details are in the `messageText` itself.

This implementation significantly solidifies your "view events" capability. The separation of concerns (tool fetches, controller orchestrates analysis, analyzer interprets) is a good pattern.

What would you like to focus on next? Testing these changes, or perhaps refining the prompts or conversation history mechanism?

```typescript
    // Inside formatConversationHistoryForPrompt
    // ...
    } else if (turn.actor === 'ASSISTANT' && turn.toolCalled?.startsWith('planner->list_events')) {
        if (turn.messageText && !turn.messageText.toLowerCase().includes("no events found")) {
            // Potentially summarize or indicate that event information was provided.
            // Be careful not to make the history too verbose.
            // A simple marker might be enough.
            messageText += `\n[System Note: I provided event information to the user.]`;
        }
    }
    // ...
```

umm the timezone shit is bad. Please look into it

---

**Cursor**

```json
        {
          "actionType": "list_events",
          "query": "work",
          "questionAboutEvents": "When do I have work next?"
        }
```

You've spotted a good point of polish! The response "in the -7:00 timezone" is technically correct based on the ISO 8601 timestamp, but it's not as user-friendly as saying "in the America/Vancouver timezone" or simply presenting the time with the understanding that it's in their local timezone.

Here's what's happening and how we can improve it:

1.  **Google Calendar API:** When you query events, even if you specify a `timeZone` for the query (which helps interpret `timeMin`/`timeMax` for all-day events and recurring event expansion), the `start.dateTime` and `end.dateTime` fields in the returned event objects are typically full ISO 8601 timestamps, often including the specific offset (like `-07:00`) or being in UTC (`Z`).
2.  **`eventContextForLLM`:** This context string, built in `chatController.ts`, includes these full ISO 8601 timestamps.
3.  **`EventAnalyzer` LLM:** When `eventAnalyzer.ts` processes this context, its LLM sees the `-07:00` and reports it literally.

**The Fix:**

We need to make the `EventAnalyzer` LLM aware of the user's preferred IANA timezone name (e.g., "America/Vancouver") and instruct it to use that in its textual responses.

**Step 1: Modify `handleEventAnalysis` to accept `userTimezone`**

I'll update `src/lib/eventAnalyzer.ts` so that `handleEventAnalysis` takes `userTimezone` as an argument. Then, I'll modify its system prompt.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
const ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing lists of calendar events to answer user questions.
Based *only* on the calendar events provided in the user's message, answer their question.
- Calculate durations, count events, or summarize information as relevant to the question.
- If the events provided do not contain enough information to definitively answer the question, state that clearly.
- Do not ask for clarification on date ranges or event details if the information is not present in the provided events; instead, indicate what information is missing based on the events at hand.
- When referring to event times in your answer, present them in a natural way (e.g., "at 2:30 PM"). If you need to specify the timezone, use the provided user's timezone name (e.g., "America/Vancouver") rather than just the offset.
- Present your answer clearly and concisely.
`;

/**
 * Analyzes a list of calendar events to answer a specific user question.
 *
 * @param userQuestion The user's question about the events.
 * @param eventDataString A string containing the list of events, formatted for the LLM.
 * @param userTimezone The IANA timezone name of the user (e.g., "America/Vancouver").
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the LLM's analytical response string.
 */
export async function handleEventAnalysis(
  userQuestion: string,
  eventDataString: string,
  userTimezone: string // Added userTimezone parameter
): Promise<string> {
  console.log(`[EventAnalyzer] Received question: "${userQuestion}" for timezone: ${userTimezone}`);
  // console.log(`[EventAnalyzer] Event data string: "${eventDataString}"`); // Log if needed for debugging, can be verbose

  // Update the system prompt dynamically or ensure the LLM understands to use the passed timezone.
  // For simplicity, the main prompt above is updated. If more dynamic injection is needed, this can be changed.
  const systemMessage = new SystemMessage(ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.replace("{userTimezoneName}", userTimezone)); // Placeholder replacement if needed, or rely on prompt update.
  // A more direct way if the prompt is already generic enough:
  // const systemMessage = new SystemMessage(ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT);
  // Then, in the human message, provide the timezone explicitly if the main prompt isn't updated directly:
  // const constructedUserMessage = `User's Timezone: ${userTimezone}\nUser's Question: ${userQuestion}\n\nProvided Events:\n${eventDataString}`;

  const constructedUserMessage = `User's Question: ${userQuestion}\n(Assume all event times are relevant to the user timezone: ${userTimezone})\n\nProvided Events:\n${eventDataString}`;

  const messages: BaseMessage[] = [
    // new SystemMessage(ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT), // Use the modified systemMessage if you chose placeholder replacement
    systemMessage, // Or the original if you rely on HumanMessage context for timezone
    new HumanMessage(constructedUserMessage),
  ];

  try {
// ... existing code ...

```

Great! `eventAnalyzer.ts` is now updated:
*   `handleEventAnalysis` accepts `userTimezone`.
*   The `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` has been improved to guide the LLM to use the IANA timezone name.
*   The `userTimezone` is also included in the `constructedUserMessage` sent to the LLM for added context.

**Step 2: Update `chatController.ts` to pass the `userTimezone`**

Now, I'll modify the `list_events` case in `src/lib/chatController.ts` to pass the `effectiveTimeZone` (which is the user's timezone) to the `handleEventAnalysis` call.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
      // --- Consistent Analysis or Summary --- 
      if (parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents) {
        if (fetchedEvents.length > 0) {
          const eventContextForLLM = fetchedEvents.map(item => 
            `Calendar: ${item.calendarId}\nEvent: ${item.summary || 'N/A'}\nStart: ${item.start?.dateTime || item.start?.date || 'N/A'}\nEnd: ${item.end?.dateTime || item.end?.date || 'N/A'}${item.description ? `\nDescription: ${item.description}`: ''}`
          ).join("\n---\n");
          console.log(`[ChatController] Calling handleEventAnalysis for question: "${parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents}" with ${fetchedEvents.length} events using timezone ${effectiveTimeZone}.`);
          toolResult = await handleEventAnalysis(parsedListParams.questionAboutEvents, eventContextForLLM, effectiveTimeZone);
        } else {
          // toolResult might have been set by ListEventsTool returning "No events found..."
          // Only set a new message if toolResult is still its initial empty string or was not a specific "no events" message.
// ... existing code ...

```

Perfect! The `chatController.ts` now correctly passes the `effectiveTimeZone` to `handleEventAnalysis`.

**Regarding the Planner and `timeMin`:**

You also brought up a good point about the planner not setting `timeMin` for a query like "When do I have work next?".

*   **Current Behavior:** If `timeMin` is not set by the planner, `apiListEvents` in `googleCalendar.ts` is called without it. The Google Calendar API typically defaults to the current time if `timeMin` is omitted, which is often the desired behavior for "what's next" type queries.
*   **Potential Improvement:** For "next" type queries, it would be more robust if the `planner.ts` (guided by `calendar.md`) explicitly set `timeMin` to `{currentTimeISO}`. This makes the query unambiguous.

**Suggestion for `calendar.md` (Planner Prompt Enhancement):**

You could add a specific instruction to `calendar.md` under "Parameter Extraction" for `list_events`:

```markdown
    *   For `list_events`:
        *   If the user asks about "next" event (e.g., "When do I have X next?", "What's my next meeting?"), set `timeMin` to the value of `{currentTimeISO}`.
        *   Extract `timeMin` and `timeMax` if a broader range is implied.
        *   Extract `query` for keywords.
        *   Extract `questionAboutEvents` if it's an analytical query.
```

This change would make the planner's output more precise for such queries.

**Testing the Timezone Fix:**

After these changes, when you ask "When do I have work next?" (assuming your test data and the fix work as expected), the `EventAnalyzer`'s response should now be more like:

"...on June 3rd, 2024, from 12:15 PM to 7:00 PM in the America/Vancouver timezone."
or
"...on June 3rd, 2024, from 12:15 PM to 7:00 PM (America/Vancouver)."
or it might even omit the timezone if it feels natural, relying on the conversational context:
"...your next work event is on June 3rd, 2024, from 12:15 PM to 7:00 PM."

The exact phrasing will depend on the LLM's interpretation of the updated prompt, but it should avoid the less friendly "-07:00 timezone."

**What's next?**

1.  I recommend you **test this timezone display fix thoroughly** with various queries.
2.  Then, if you'd like, we can work on the `calendar.md` prompt enhancement to make the planner set `timeMin` for "next" event queries.

Let me know how the testing goes!

```markdown
    *   For `list_events`:
        *   If the user asks about "next" event (e.g., "When do I have X next?", "What's my next meeting?"), set `timeMin` to the value of `{currentTimeISO}`.
        *   Extract `timeMin` and `timeMax` if a broader range is implied.
        *   Extract `query` for keywords.
        *   Extract `questionAboutEvents` if it's an analytical query.
```

**User**

THis should not happen. Lets implement memory for this too. Just like we did in delete events or create events, we will log the LLM end response(which the user gets) in the logs so that the context of the convo is maintained and I can have back and forth convos like these

---

**Cursor**

```typescript
    // ...
    } else if (turn.actor === 'ASSISTANT' && turn.toolCalled?.startsWith('planner->list_events')) {
        if (turn.messageText && !turn.messageText.toLowerCase().includes("no events found")) {
            messageText += `\n[System Note: I provided event information to the user.]`;
        }
    }
    // ...
```

You're absolutely right. The conversation flow you've shown highlights a classic problem in conversational AI: maintaining context for follow-up questions. The `centralOrchestratorLLM` should have understood that "What time?" was directly related to "your next work day is May 22, 2025."

The solution, as you've pointed out, lies in ensuring the conversation history is not just logged, but effectively *used* by the `centralOrchestratorLLM`. The actual text of the assistant's previous response *is* being included in `formattedHistory` via `turn.messageText`. The main gap is in the `centralOrchestratorLLM`'s system prompt, guiding it to leverage this immediate history for short, contextual follow-ups.

Let's enhance the system prompt for the `centralOrchestratorLLM` (specifically the "Standard request processing" mode) to address this.
I'll add a new section to its instructions emphasizing how to handle these kinds of follow-up questions by paying close attention to the immediately preceding assistant's turn.

---

**User**

continue please

---

**Cursor**

Okay, let's modify the system prompt for the `centralOrchestratorLLM` in `src/lib/centralOrchestratorLLM.ts`. I'll add specific instructions for handling follow-up questions by referencing the conversation history.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
  } else {
    // Mode: Standard request processing (Phase 1 logic)
    systemPromptContent = `You are a top-level AI orchestrator for a calendar assistant. Your primary goal is to understand the user's intent based on their latest message and the provided conversation history.

    User's Timezone: ${userTimezone}
    User's Available Calendars: ${userCalendarsFormatted || 'Not available'}

    Conversation History (if available):
    ${formattedHistory}
    (When reviewing history, ASSISTANT turns may have a 'toolResult' field if a tool was successfully used, or a 'System Note' if it summarized an action like event creation. The ASSISTANT's actual textual response to the user is in 'messageText'.)

    **Handling Follow-up Questions:**
    Pay close attention to the last ASSISTANT message in the 'Conversation History'. 
    If the user's current message is short and seems to directly follow up on the information the assistant just provided (e.g., User: "What time is that?" after Assistant: "Your next work event is on May 22nd."), you MUST interpret the user's message in that context.
    - If the follow-up implies a new calendar operation based on the context (e.g., User: "Cancel it" after Assistant: "You have a meeting at 2 PM titled 'Project Sync'"), then formulate a comprehensive input for the 'call_planner' action by combining the user's implicit intent with the details from the previous turn. For example, for "Cancel it", the input to the planner might become "Cancel the 'Project Sync' meeting at 2 PM".
    - If the follow-up asks for more details about something the assistant just mentioned (e.g., User: "What is the location?" after Assistant: "Your next event is 'Team Lunch'"), and this requires looking up calendar information again, use 'call_planner' with a specific query (e.g., "What is the location of the 'Team Lunch' event?").
    - If the follow-up is a simple acknowledgment or doesn't require a calendar action, 'respond_directly' might be appropriate.

    Based on the user's message (provided separately) and the conversation history (especially the last assistant turn for follow-ups), decide the best course of action. 

    Your available actions are:
    1. 'call_planner': If the user's request seems like a new calendar-related task (creating, listing, updating, deleting events) that requires detailed parsing of dates, times, summaries, etc., OR if it's a follow-up question that requires a new calendar operation or re-querying for more details (as described under "Handling Follow-up Questions"). The planner is specialized for this.
       - If the request is for a DELETION task (e.g., "delete the meeting I just scheduled", "remove the events you created earlier"):
         - Assess if the user is likely asking to delete a SINGLE item or MULTIPLE/UNSPECIFIED items. Include this assessment in 'params.originalRequestNature': 'singular' or 'plural_or_unspecified'.
         - **IMPORTANT FOR DELETING RECENTLY CREATED EVENTS:** If the user refers to deleting events "just scheduled" or "you just created", examine the recent ASSISTANT turns in the 'Conversation History'. Look for 'toolResult' or 'System Note' that contains details of created events (like an array of event objects with 'start' and 'end' properties or summaries). If found, calculate a consolidated 'timeMin' and 'timeMax' that encompasses all such recently created events. Pass these 'timeMin' and 'timeMax' values in the 'params' object to the planner. This helps the planner accurately scope the deletion. If no such events are found in history, or the reference is not clearly to *just* created events, let the planner determine timeMin/Max.
    2. 'respond_directly': If the user's message is a general chat, a greeting, a simple thank you, or if the conversation history (including a recent assistant response) indicates the current message doesn't require a calendar action or can be answered directly from the very recent context of the conversation. For example, if the assistant just listed events and the user asks "is the first one a work event?", and the assistant's previous message text clearly contains this detail, you *could* respond directly if the information is trivial to extract from the immediate past turn. However, for complex extractions or if unsure, prefer 'call_planner'.
    3. 'ask_user_question': If the user's intent is unclear *before calling any tools or the planner*, and you need to ask a clarifying question before proceeding with any other action. This should generally not be used for follow-up questions where context is available; instead, use 'call_planner' with a refined query for such cases.
    
    Output your decision ONLY as a single, valid JSON object matching the following schema, with no other surrounding text or markdown:
    {
      "actionType": "call_planner" | "respond_directly" | "ask_user_question",
      "params": { 
        "userInput": "The input for the planner. If the user's current message is a follow-up referring to details from a previous turn (e.g., 'do that again but change X', 'add those with summary Y', 'what time is that?'), combine the key details (like times, dates, locations, summaries of events just mentioned by assistant) from the relevant previous turn(s) in the conversation history with the user's current message to form a complete instruction for the planner. For entirely new requests, this will just be the user's current message. Use common sense and formulate a clear, actionable request for the planner.",
        "originalRequestNature": "<If actionType is call_planner AND intent is deletion, specify 'singular' or 'plural_or_unspecified'. Omit otherwise.>",
        "timeMin": "<Optional: If deleting 'just created' events, provide calculated ISO8601 timeMin based on history. Planner will use this. Also applicable if a follow-up implies a time constraint for the planner based on previous turns.>",
        "timeMax": "<Optional: If deleting 'just created' events, provide calculated ISO8601 timeMax based on history. Planner will use this. Also applicable if a follow-up implies a time constraint for the planner based on previous turns.>"
      },
      "responseText": "If actionType is 'respond_directly' or 'ask_user_question', this is your textual response to the user. Otherwise, this can be omitted. Be as human-like and kind as possible. Act like a personal assistant.",
      "reasoning": "Briefly explain your decision.",
      "clarificationContextToSave": null
    }
    
    Prioritize 'call_planner' for anything that looks like a new calendar modification task or a contextual follow-up needing calendar data. If the user is just saying "hi" or "thanks", use "respond_directly". If very unsure, use "ask_user_question", but prefer re-querying via planner for ambiguous follow-ups.
    Ensure the output is nothing but the JSON object.`;
  }

  const messages = [];
// ... existing code ...

```

Excellent. The system prompt for the `centralOrchestratorLLM` in `src/lib/centralOrchestratorLLM.ts` has been updated significantly.

Key changes include:

*   A new section: `**Handling Follow-up Questions:**` which explicitly tells the LLM to look at the last assistant's message.
*   Guidance on how to interpret short follow-ups in the context of the assistant's prior response.
*   Instructions to formulate a comprehensive input for the `call_planner` action by combining the user's implicit intent with details from the previous turn for follow-ups that require new calendar operations or re-querying.
*   Refined descriptions for `actionType: "call_planner"` and `actionType: "respond_directly"` to incorporate this new follow-up handling logic.
*   Updated instructions for the `params.userInput`, `params.timeMin`, and `params.timeMax` fields to reflect how they should be populated for follow-up questions.
*   General strengthening of the idea that `call_planner` is preferred for contextual follow-ups needing calendar data, while `ask_user_question` should be reserved for when the initial intent is very unclear, not for contextual follow-ups.

**With these changes, the expected behavior for your example:**

1.  **User:** "What day do I have work next?"
2.  **Assistant (after full flow):** "Based on the provided calendar events, your next work day is May 22, 2025."
    *   This response is now in `conversationHistory` as `turn.actor === 'ASSISTANT'` with `turn.messageText = "Based on the provided..."`
3.  **User:** "What time?"
4.  **`centralOrchestratorLLM` (with the new prompt):**
    *   Sees "What time?" from the user.
    *   Looks at the `formattedHistory` and identifies the last assistant message: "Based on the provided calendar events, your next work day is May 22, 2025."
    *   Understands "What time?" refers to the work event on May 22, 2025.
    *   Decides `actionType: "call_planner"`.
    *   Constructs `params.userInput` for the planner like: "What time is work on May 22, 2025?" or "Regarding the work event on May 22, 2025, what time is it?".
    *   It might also populate `params.timeMin` and `params.timeMax` to scope the planner's search to May 22, 2025.
5.  **`planner.ts`:**
    *   Receives the more specific query from the orchestrator.
    *   Determines `actionType: "list_events"`, `questionAboutEvents: "What time is work on May 22, 2025?"`, `timeMin` and `timeMax` for May 22.
6.  **`chatController.ts` and `eventAnalyzer.ts`:**
    *   Fetch events for May 22.
    *   `eventAnalyzer.ts` answers the specific question about the time of the work event(s) on that day.
7.  **Assistant:** Provides the specific time(s).

This should now handle such follow-up questions much more gracefully.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Test Thoroughly:** This is a significant change to the orchestrator's logic. Test with:
    *   The original scenario: "What day do I have work next?" -> "What time?"
    *   Other follow-ups after listing events:
        *   Assistant: "You have 'Team Lunch' at 1 PM and 'Project Sync' at 3 PM."
        *   User: "What's the location of the first one?"
        *   User: "Cancel 'Project Sync'."
        *   User: "Make the team lunch 30 minutes longer."
    *   Follow-ups after creating an event:
        *   Assistant: "Okay, I've scheduled 'Budget Meeting' for tomorrow at 10 AM."
        *   User: "Add John to it."
        *   User: "Actually, can you move it to 11 AM?"
    *   Ensure it *doesn't* get stuck and still handles brand new, unrelated queries correctly after a follow-up.

2.  **Review `formatConversationHistoryForPrompt` (in `centralOrchestratorLLM.ts`):**
    *   You already have a `[System Note: I successfully scheduled: ...]` for created events.
    *   You might also consider if adding a similar concise `[System Note: I provided event information about X]` after `list_events` (especially analytical ones) would further help the orchestrator identify that the assistant "saw" something specific. This is optional, as the assistant's `messageText` itself is the primary source of that context for the LLM. The current prompt changes already heavily emphasize looking at `messageText`.

3.  **Planner Prompt (`calendar.md`) for `timeMin`/`timeMax` in Follow-ups:**
    *   The orchestrator's prompt now suggests it can pass `timeMin` and `timeMax` to the planner if a follow-up implies a time constraint based on previous turns.
    *   Ensure `calendar.md` instructs the planner: "If `timeMin` and `timeMax` are provided to you by the system (e.g., from an orchestrator processing a follow-up), YOU SHOULD USE THESE EXACT `timeMin` and `timeMax` values for your event search/listing. Do not try to re-calculate or infer them from the user's text in this case, unless the user's text explicitly overrides them (e.g., 'no, look at next week instead')." This was already partially in your `delete_event` instructions but can be generalized or emphasized for `list_events` too if the orchestrator is passing them.

This is a substantial improvement to the agent's conversational abilities! Let me know how your testing goes.

Why dosent it see any classes for the 10th? Lke when i say what events i  have on 20th it shows me 2 lectrues but says no classes. I think this is an LLM issue right? LIke idk maybe the temp is too low? Pls figure smth out for this and please for the love of god dont overfit. I dont like overfitting, I just want the LLM to be right and have the freedom to interpret what the user means and then match the appropriate events with the query.

---

**Cursor**

Okay, you've hit on a very common and tricky challenge in NLP and task-oriented systems: semantic matching and understanding user intent beyond literal keywords.

You're right, if the `EventAnalyzer` LLM is too rigid, it might see events titled "Lecture: Advanced Calculus" and when asked "Do I have any classes?", it could respond "No classes found" if it doesn't equate "lecture" with "class" in that context.

**Why this happens:**

*   **Literal Matching:** LLMs, especially at lower temperatures, can sometimes default to more literal interpretations.
*   **Prompt Specificity:** The `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` might not explicitly tell the LLM to consider synonyms or related terms for event types.
*   **Data in Calendar:** The actual event titles ("Lecture," "Tutorial," "Work Block," etc.) are the raw data the LLM sees.

**How to Address This (Without Overfitting):**

Your concern about overfitting is valid. We don't want to list every possible synonym for "class" in the prompt. Instead, we want to guide the LLM to be smarter about *semantic similarity* and *contextual understanding*.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Refine `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `src/lib/eventAnalyzer.ts`:**
    *   We can add a general instruction to the LLM to be mindful of how users might describe events and to look for conceptual matches, not just exact keyword matches.
    *   The goal is to make it understand that if a user asks about "classes," it should consider events that are typically academic sessions, like "lectures," "tutorials," "labs," "seminars," etc., based on common understanding.

2.  **Temperature and Model (Less Likely the Primary Issue Here, but a Factor):**
    *   The `eventAnalyzerModel` uses `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` with `temperature: 0.3`. This temperature is generally good for factual Q&A based on provided text. Raising it slightly *could* make it more flexible, but also slightly increases the risk of less precise answers. I'd focus on the prompt first, as it's a more direct control. The model itself is very capable.

**Proposed Change to `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT`:**

Let's add a line to encourage more flexible interpretation of event types.

I'll apply this change to `src/lib/eventAnalyzer.ts`.

```typescript
// ... existing code ...
const ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing lists of calendar events to answer user questions.
Based *only* on the calendar events provided in the user's message, answer their question.
- Calculate durations, count events, or summarize information as relevant to the question.
- If the events provided do not contain enough information to definitively answer the question, state that clearly.
- Do not ask for clarification on date ranges or event details if the information is not present in the provided events; instead, indicate what information is missing based on the events at hand.
- When referring to event times in your answer, present them in a natural way (e.g., "at 2:30 PM"). If you need to specify the timezone, use the provided user's timezone name (e.g., "America/Vancouver") rather than just the offset.
- **Understand that users may use various terms for similar types of events (e.g., asking for "classes" might refer to events titled "lectures", "tutorials", or "seminars"; asking for "meetings" might refer to "appointments" or "syncs"). Focus on matching the user's likely intent to the event summaries and details provided.**
- Present your answer clearly and concisely.
`;

/**
// ... existing code ...

```

Okay, the `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `src/lib/eventAnalyzer.ts` has been updated with the new instruction:

> "- **Understand that users may use various terms for similar types of events (e.g., asking for "classes" might refer to events titled "lectures", "tutorials", or "seminars"; asking for "meetings" might refer to "appointments" or "syncs"). Focus on matching the user's likely intent to the event summaries and details provided.**"

This is a good, general way to nudge the LLM towards better semantic understanding without hardcoding lists of synonyms (which would be overfitting).

**Why this is a better approach than simply increasing temperature:**

*   **Directed Guidance:** Prompt engineering gives you more precise control over the desired behavior.
*   **Maintaining Factualness:** We still want the `EventAnalyzer` to be factual based on the provided event data. A slightly higher temperature could introduce more creativity or speculation, which we want to avoid for this particular LLM's role.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** If this doesn't fully solve the issue, we can further refine this part of the prompt with more nuanced instructions about interpreting event types based on common sense or typical calendar usage patterns.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Test This Change:**
    *   Re-run the query: "Don’t I have any classes on 20th then?"
    *   Try variations: "Show me my lectures for the 20th.", "Any tutorials on May 20th?", "What academic sessions are on the 20th?"
    *   The goal is to see if the `EventAnalyzer` now correctly identifies events titled "Lecture: ..." or similar as "classes" when asked.
    *   Observe the `[EventAnalyzer] LLM Analysis Response` in your logs.

2.  **Further Prompt Refinement (If Needed):**
    *   If the LLM is still too literal, we might consider adding a phrase like: "When a user asks for a general category of event like 'classes' or 'meetings', consider events whose summaries suggest they belong to that category even if the exact keyword isn't present. Use common sense context."

3.  **Consider the `query` parameter passed to `listEvents`:**
    *   In your log, the `planner` for "When do i have work next?" generated:
        ```json
        {
          "actionType": "list_events",
          "query": "work",
          "questionAboutEvents": "When do I have work next?"
        }
        ```
    *   And for "What day do i have work next?":
        ```json
        {
          "actionType": "list_events",
          "calendarId": "f734...group.calendar.google.com", // Explicitly chose "Work" calendar
          "timeMin": "2025-05-20T00:00:00-07:00",
          "questionAboutEvents": "What day do i have work next?"
        }
        ```
        Notice the second plan doesn't have a `query: "work"` but has a `calendarId` for the "Work" calendar.
    *   The `apiListEvents` function in `googleCalendar.ts` uses the `q` parameter for keyword search. If the `planner` correctly identifies a specific calendar (like your "Work" calendar) AND provides a keyword query like "class" or "lecture", it could help pre-filter.
    *   However, for broad analytical questions ("Do I have any classes?"), we often want to fetch *all* events in the time range for the selected calendars and let the `EventAnalyzer` do the semantic filtering. This is generally more robust. The current approach seems to lean towards letting the `EventAnalyzer` do this, which is fine.

The current prompt change is a good step. Let's see how it performs in your tests. This iterative process of testing and refining prompts is key to getting the desired LLM behavior.

```json
        {
          "actionType": "list_events",
          "query": "work",
          "questionAboutEvents": "When do I have work next?"
        }
```

```json
        {
          "actionType": "list_events",
          "calendarId": "f734...group.calendar.google.com", // Explicitly chose "Work" calendar
          "timeMin": "2025-05-20T00:00:00-07:00",
          "questionAboutEvents": "What day do i have work next?"
        }
```
